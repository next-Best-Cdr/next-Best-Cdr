### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**next-Best-Cdr/next-Best-Cdr** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on picking up more hobbies.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my squats and deadlift pr.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I originally went to school to become a doctor, but i lost interest in that field. Very active day trader, religious gym rat. Now im learning to code.... i gues you can say i have great potential.
